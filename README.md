### 💻 What is this project about?
This is a coding challenge, the main goal is build an tic-tac-toe application following those tasks
- build a 3x3 board
- when a square gets clicked, mark down an X or O
- track the play os two players
- create an alert when the game end with a winner (or tie)

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- React
- Sass

### 🧠 What i've learned
- Building the state of winning/tie condition:<br>
In the <a href="github.com/paulomonezi/tic-tac-toe-react" target="_blank">other</a> tic-tac-toe application, i've mapped all the  9 winning possibilities into an array to check if the game has a winner, in this app, i've builded differently<br>
Everytime a player makes a move, we have a 1 or -1 on that square, then a for loop runs and check the sum of the rows, columns and diagonals, if one of them is equals 3 or -3, we have a winner.
